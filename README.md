## 1. Introduction
ngxway```[Nginx Way]```is a high-performance lightweight Nginx gateway service based on Openresty.

## 2. Features

### (1) High performance and low time consumption

Based on Openresty and Lua extensions, the Nginx layer gateway service with high performance and low time consumption is realized. For performance, you can check the detailed [benchmark test report](https://wgrape.github.io/ngxway/html/benchmark.html).

It's automatically generated by [bin/ngxway_benchmark](./bin/ngxway_benchmark).

### (2) Containerized and easy to deploy

Based on Docker, it is decoupled from the underlying configuration of Nginx, eliminating all the construction process, and can automatically build its own Nginx gateway service with one command.
